the index page in src directory is the first page that you are going to see when press nutrition button in login container. first of all we check if the person is authenticated or not by the help of is_authenticated().in the mentioned function we set two values wich is username and session. if the function returns true we are allowed to see the page otherwise we can not see the page since our session has been expired or any other problem like wrong username or etc. .
because of ajax benefits adding a course,deleting a course and watching reserved courses in the index page, ajax has been used three times.
is_authentication() functin not only used in index page but aslo used before each request to data base. for instance in add-food.php file first we check is_authentiacated() function and after that logedin user is able to send it's query to data base.
